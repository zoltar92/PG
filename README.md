Portal to your dreams coming true



This portal will be password gated (no need to require account names/password recovery...etc.
We could have 50-100 pregenerated random passwords?


Once in there should be one of two things:

1) using moz a-frame allow people to stream select youporn vids.
Note: The video's should be 360 vr not just usual VR.
http://www.pornhub.com/video/search?search=360+vr

Also note: Sometimes when not using a third-party app (like freeVRPlayer) it'll have the video split vertically (as opposed to horizontlly). It's my hope that moz a frame allows us to process these videos and split screen vertically. If not then we can skip to part two


2) If we can't feasibly set up 1 easily then instead lets make it so  when you pop in it first has you download the free VR player (that pornhub makes you download. And then deep-links you into a video. Note: This is an importnat part, as with PornHub, if you click play (even if you have downloaded the app, it plays the video in the wrong format. Instead, you would have to reclick the "downlaod free vr player" which deeplinks you to the video. Our link should for the video should automatically deeplink you into the app.

Brandon can give you designs.
